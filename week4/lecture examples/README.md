# Week 4 Lecture Examples

## Vector Addition
This MATLAB function takes two vectors of the same length as input and calculates their sum. It checks if the lengths of the input vectors are not the same, displaying an error message. Otherwise, it adds the vectors element-wise and returns the resulting vector.

## Vector Dot Product
This MATLAB function computes the dot product of two given vectors. It checks the lengths of the input vectors, displaying an error message if they are different. Otherwise, it calculates the dot product by multiplying the elements of the vectors and returns it as a scalar value.

## Vector Norm Calculation
This MATLAB function calculates the Euclidean norm (L2 norm) of a given vector. It takes the vector as input and returns its norm.

## Vector Cross Product
This MATLAB function computes the cross product of two 3-dimensional vectors. It checks if the vectors have appropriate dimensions and displays the resulting vector.

## Vector Sorting
This MATLAB function employs the Quick Sort algorithm to arrange a given vector in ascending order. Quick Sort operates by selecting a pivot element from the vector, partitioning the vector into sub-vectors where elements smaller than the pivot are placed on the left and elements greater than the pivot are placed on the right, and recursively sorting these sub-vectors. Through testing with various input vectors, the function verifies both its correctness and efficiency in sorting operations.
