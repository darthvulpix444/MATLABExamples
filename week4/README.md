# Week 4 All Examples

## Vector Addition
This MATLAB function takes two vectors of the same length as input and calculates their sum. It checks if the lengths of the input vectors are not the same, displaying an error message. Otherwise, it adds the vectors element-wise and returns the resulting vector.

## Vector Dot Product
This MATLAB function computes the dot product of two given vectors. It checks the lengths of the input vectors, displaying an error message if they are different. Otherwise, it calculates the dot product by multiplying the elements of the vectors and returns it as a scalar value.

## Vector Norm Calculation
This MATLAB function calculates the Euclidean norm (L2 norm) of a given vector. It takes the vector as input and returns its norm.

## Vector Cross Product
This MATLAB function computes the cross product of two 3-dimensional vectors. It checks if the vectors have appropriate dimensions and displays the resulting vector.

## Vector Sorting
This MATLAB function sorts a given vector in ascending order using any sorting algorithm chosen. It tests the function with different input vectors to ensure correctness and efficiency.
