# Week 4 All Examples
## Vector Addition
Write a MATLAB script that takes two vectors of the same length as input and calculates their sum. Display the resulting vector. Ensure that your script handles vectors of different lengths gracefully.
## Vector Dot Product
Implement a MATLAB function to compute the dot product of two given vectors. The function should return a scalar value representing the dot product. Test your function with different pairs of vectors.
## Vector Norm Calculation
Create a MATLAB function that calculates the Euclidean norm (L2 norm) of a given vector. The function should take the vector as input and return its norm. Test your function with various vectors.
## Vector Cross Product
Write a MATLAB script to compute the cross product of two 3-dimensional vectors. Ensure that your script handles vectors of appropriate dimensions and display the resulting vector.
## Vector Sorting
Implement a MATLAB function to sort a given vector in ascending order. You can use any sorting algorithm of your choice (e.g., bubble sort, quicksort, etc.). Test your function with different input vectors to ensure correctness and efficiency.
