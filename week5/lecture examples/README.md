# Week 5 Lecture Examples 
## Discrete Unit Sample Function
This MATLAB code generates a discrete unit sample function with using the stem plot. Range of values starts from -10 to 10 for the independent variable. Stem plot will display filled markers.

## Element-Wise Multiplying
This MATLAB code has two discrete signals x = [0, 2, 3, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0] and y = [0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0]. Then calculates resulting signals when multiplying them element-wise and when adding them together. Finally code will plot these resulting signals against the discrete time variable n = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7].

## Discrete-Time Unit Step Function
This MATLAB code generates and plots a discrete-time unit step function x(n) defined over the range −20≤n≤20. The function should be 1 for n≥0 and 0 otherwise. Also code has for loop and conditionals for this implementation.

## Stem Plot of Discrete Signal
This MATLAB code generates a stem plot for the given discrete signal [-5,15]. After all values ​​of the given function are set to zero, the calculation is made according to the following segmented function. Finally, graph is drawn with the stem command.

## Generating Data with a 1000 Hz Sample Frequency
This MATLAB code generates data with a sample frequency of 1000 Hz, one needs to create a time vector in MATLAB. For this purpose, one can use the expression (0:0.001:1)'. This expression creates a 1001-element column vector representing time ranging from 0 to 1 second in steps of 1 millisecond (ms). Here, (0:0.001:1) represents the time from 0 to 1 second. Finally combines signal function which is "mag*cos(2πft)
