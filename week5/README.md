# Week 5 All Examples

## Discrete Unit Sample Function 
This MATLAB code generates a discrete unit sample function with using the stem plot. Range of values starts from -10 to 10 for the independent variable. Stem plot will display filled markers.

## Element-Wise Multiplying
This MATLAB code has two discrete signals x = [0, 2, 3, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0] and y = [0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0]. Then calculates resulting signals when multiplying them element-wise and when adding them together. Finally code will plot these resulting signals against the discrete time variable n = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7].
