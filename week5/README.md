# Week 5 All Examples

## Discrete Unit Sample Function 
This MATLAB code generates a discrete unit sample function with using the stem plot. Range of values starts from -10 to 10 for the independent variable. Stem plot will display filled markers.

## Element-Wise Multiplying
This MATLAB code has two discrete signals x = [0, 2, 3, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0] and y = [0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0]. Then calculates resulting signals when multiplying them element-wise and when adding them together. Finally code will plot these resulting signals against the discrete time variable n = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7].

## Discrete-Time Unit Step Function
This MATLAB code generates and plots a discrete-time unit step function x(n) defined over the range −20≤n≤20. The function should be 1 for n≥0 and 0 otherwise. Also code has for loop and conditionals for this implementation.

## Example 4
Write MATLAB code to generate a stem plot for the discrete signal ( y[n] ), where ( n = -5:15 ) and ( y[n] ) is defined as:
[ y[n] = \begin{cases} 2 & \text{if } n = 3 \ 1 & \text{if } n = 0, 5, 10 \ 0 & \text{otherwise} \end{cases} ]
Ensure the plot includes appropriate title, x-axis label, y-axis label, grid lines, and customized appearance for the stem markers.
