## Parabolic Signal (Example 1)

This MATLAB code generates a parabolic signal with a specific sampling frequency and visualizes it over time.

- Setting the Sampling Frequency: Fs = 1000; sets the sampling frequency (Fs) to 1000 Hz. This means the signal is sampled 1000 times per second.

- Calculating the Sampling Period: The sampling period (T) is calculated as the inverse of the sampling frequency: T = 1/Fs;. This determines the time interval between each sample of the signal.

- Determining the Length of the Signal: L = 1000; sets the length of the signal (L) to 1000 samples.

- Creating the Time Vector: The time vector (t) is created using the sampling period and length of the signal: t = (0:L-1)*T;. This vector contains the time values for the signal.

- Generating the Parabolic Signal: The parabolic signal is generated by squaring the time vector: parabolic_signal = t.^2;. This creates a parabolic signal that increases with time.

- Visualizing the Signal: The generated parabolic signal is plotted against the time vector using the plot function: plot(t, parabolic_signal);. Additionally, the title and axis labels are set for the plot.
